#### hi  

Hi there! I'm ready for your request.

#### create langgraph project at ./ ,which has midjouney tool.  

Okay, I can help you set up a basic LangGraph project structure with a placeholder Midjourney tool.

This will involve creating several new files:
1.  `./pyproject.toml` for project dependencies and metadata (using Poetry).
2.  `./langgraph_project/__init__.py` to make `langgraph_project` a Python package.
3.  `./langgraph_project/tools/__init__.py` to make `tools` a sub-package.
4.  `./langgraph_project/tools/midjourney.py` for the Midjourney tool implementation.
5.  `./langgraph_project/agent.py` to define the LangGraph agent and graph logic.
6.  `./run.py` as an example script to execute the graph.
7.  `./README.md` with setup and usage instructions.

Here are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to create these files:

# LangGraph Midjourney Project

This project demonstrates a simple LangGraph agent capable of using a (mock) Midjourney tool to generate images, alongside general conversational abilities powered by an LLM.

## Setup

1.  **Create Project Files:**
    Ensure all project files (`pyproject.toml`, `run.py`, and the `langgraph_project` directory with its contents) are created as specified.

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses Poetry for dependency management.
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    poetry install
    ```
    This will install all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    # If your actual Midjourney tool requires an API key:
    # MIDJOURNEY_API_KEY="your_midjourney_api_key_here"
    ```
    Replace `"your_openai_api_key_here"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Running the Agent

Once the setup is complete, you can run the agent using the `run.py` script:

```bash
python run.py
```

The script will execute two predefined queries:
1.  A request to generate an image, which should trigger the Midjourney tool.
2.  A general question, which the LLM should answer directly.

## Project Structure

-   `pyproject.toml`: Defines project metadata and dependencies for Poetry.
-   `run.py`: The main script to execute the LangGraph agent.
-   `langgraph_project/`: The core Python package for the LangGraph application.
    -   `__init__.py`: Initializes the `langgraph_project` package and exports the `app`.
    -   `agent.py`: Contains the definition of the agent's state, tools, model, nodes, and the graph itself.
    -   `tools/`: A sub-package for custom tools.
        -   `__init__.py`: Initializes the `tools` sub-package.
        -   `midjourney.py`: Implements the mock Midjourney tool.
-   `.env` (to be created by you): Stores sensitive information like API keys.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Customization

-   **Tools**: Add more tools to the `langgraph_project/tools/` directory, import them in `agent.py`, and add them to the `tools` list.
-   **Model**: Change the LLM by modifying the `model` initialization in `agent.py` (e.g., use a different provider like Anthropic or a local model).
-   **Agent Logic**: Modify the nodes and edges in `agent.py` to change the agent's behavior and control flow.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After creating these files, you'll need to:

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project (`./.env`) with your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-api-key-here"
    # Add MIDJOURNEY_API_KEY if your actual tool needs it
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**. If you have Poetry installed, you can run:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    If you don't have Poetry, you can install it first, or manually install the packages listed in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `pip install langchain langgraph langchain_openai python-dotenv tavily-python`).

3.  **Run the example**:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

This should give you a good starting point for your LangGraph project with a Midjourney tool. Let me know if you have any other questions!

#### use uv for package manager  

Okay, I will update the project configuration and documentation to use `uv` instead of Poetry.

1.  **Update `pyproject.toml`**: Remove Poetry-specific sections (`[tool.poetry]`, `[build-system]`) and restructure dependencies under the standard `[project]` table.
2.  **Update `README.md`**: Replace Poetry installation commands with equivalent `uv` commands.

    # Or install directly from pyproject.toml
    uv pip install .
    ```

After applying these changes, you might want to:

2.  Generate a new lock file using `uv`.
3.  Reinstall dependencies using `uv`.

rm poetry.lock
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock
uv pip sync requirements.lock

"Go ahead" with what exactly? My last proposed change was to update the `README.md` to use `venv` instead of `.venv`, and I already provided the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for that.

Do you want me to provide those blocks again, or do you have a new request for changes to the files you just added?

> Tokens: 9.6k sent, 73 received.  

#### run project  

Okay, to run the project, you first need to ensure your virtual environment is activated and the dependencies are installed (as described in the `README.md`).

Once that's done, you can run the main script using the following command:

```bash
python run.py
```

#### /run ls  
> Add 0.1k tokens of command output to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o [Yes]: n  

#### add langgraph node diagram creation code  

Okay, I can add code to generate a diagram of your LangGraph workflow. This typically involves using the `.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()` method available on the compiled LangGraph application. This requires installing additional dependencies: `pygraphviz` and `matplotlib`. We'll also add `Pillow` to handle the image data.

1.  **Modify `pyproject.toml`**: Add `pygraphviz`, `matplotlib`, and `pillow` to the dependencies.
2.  **Modify `run.py`**: Add code to generate the diagram and save it as a PNG file (e.g., `workflow_diagram.png`) when the script is run.
3.  **Modify `README.md`**: Update the setup instructions to include the new dependencies and mention the generated diagram file.

#### fix error  

The error message `fatal error: 'graphviz/cgraph.h' file not found` indicates that the `pygraphviz` Python package cannot find the necessary header files from the `graphviz` system library during installation.

As noted in the `README.md`, you need to install the `graphviz` library using your system's package manager before installing `pygraphviz` with `uv`.

Since you are on macOS, you should run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew install graphviz
```

After successfully installing `graphviz` with Homebrew, please try installing the Python dependencies again:

```bash
uv pip sync requirements.lock
```

This should resolve the build error for `pygraphviz`. No changes to the project code files are needed.

#### What's wrong? Fix  

The error message indicates a conflict between your project's specified Python version requirement and the requirements of the `pygraphviz` package.

Specifically:
*   Your `pyproject.toml` states the project requires Python `">=3.9"`.
*   The `pygraphviz` versions you need (`>=1.12`) require Python `">=3.10"`.

To fix this, you need to update the minimum Python version required by your project in `pyproject.toml` to `>=3.10`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* for `pyproject.toml`:

````toml

<<<<<<< SEARCH

After applying this change, it's a good idea to regenerate the lock file and sync your environment:

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock
uv pip sync requirements.lock
```

Then, try running the script again:

```bash
uv run python run.py
```

Okay, I will replace the mock Midjourney tool with one that uses the Stability AI API based on the code you provided.

This involves:
1.  **Updating `pyproject.toml`**: Add the `requests` library as a dependency.
2.  **Updating `langgraph_project/tools/midjourney.py`**: Replace the existing `midjourney_image_generator` function with the new implementation. This new version will:
    *   Use the `requests` library.
    *   Fetch the Stability AI API key from the `STABILITY_API_KEY` environment variable.
    *   Call the Stability AI API.
    *   Save the generated image to a file named based on the prompt (e.g., `./generated_image_lighthouse_on_a_cliff.webp`).
    *   Return a success message with the filename or an error message.
3.  **Updating `README.md`**: Add instructions for installing `requests` and setting the `STABILITY_API_KEY` environment variable.

After applying these changes, you need to:

1.  **Add your Stability AI API key** to your `.env` file:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    STABILITY_API_KEY="sk-your_stability_ai_api_key_here"

    # uv pip install .
    ```
3.  **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

Now, when the agent receives the image generation prompt, it should call the Stability AI API, save the image locally (e.g., `generated_image_generate_an_image_of_a_futuristic_city_at_sunset.webp`), and return a message indicating success and the filename.

#### modify project with gradio library for web chat interfacwe  

Okay, I can help you integrate a Gradio web chat interface into your project.

This will involve these main steps:
1.  Add `gradio` to your project's dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
2.  Create a new Python file, `app_gradio.py`, in the root of your project. This script will define and launch the Gradio web interface.
3.  Update `README.md` to include instructions for installing `gradio` and running the new web interface.

The Gradio interface will allow users to chat with your LangGraph agent. If the agent generates an image using the Stability AI tool, the interface will display the image along with any textual response from the agent.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

First, let's add `gradio` to your `pyproject.toml`:
````toml

## Running the Agent

Once the setup is complete, you can run the agent using the `run.py` script:

```bash
python run.py
```

The script will execute two predefined queries:
1.  A request to generate an image, which should trigger the Midjourney tool.
2.  A general question, which the LLM should answer directly.

It will also generate a `workflow_diagram.png` file in the project root, visualizing the structure of the LangGraph agent.
=======
## Running the Agent

This project offers two ways to interact with the agent:

### 1. Web Chat Interface (Recommended)

Once the setup is complete, you can start the Gradio web interface:

```bash
python app_gradio.py
```

This will launch a local web server (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:7860` or similar), which you can open in your browser to chat with the agent. The interface supports text conversation and image display if the agent generates an image.

### 2. Command-Line Interface

You can also run the agent using the `run.py` script for basic command-line interaction:

```bash
python run.py
```

The `run.py` script will execute two predefined queries:
1.  A request to generate an image.
2.  A general question.

The `run.py` script can also generate a `workflow_diagram.png` file (if uncommented) visualizing the LangGraph agent's structure.

After applying these changes, you'll need to install the new `gradio` dependency:

```bash
# Optional: Re-compile the lock file if you use one
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock
# Install/sync dependencies
uv pip sync requirements.lock
# Or if you don't use a lock file:
# uv pip install . 
# (Ensure you have `requests` and `gradio` in pyproject.toml)

Then, you can launch the Gradio web interface with:

```bash
python app_gradio.py
```
Open the URL provided in your terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) in a web browser to start chatting with your agent.

#### What's wrong? Fix  

The `TypeError` you're encountering, `ChatInterface.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'retry_btn'`, means that the version of Gradio you are using (`gradio==5.29.0` as per your `requirements.lock`) does not support `retry_btn`, `undo_btn`, and `clear_btn` as direct parameters to `gr.ChatInterface`. In newer versions of Gradio, these buttons are often enabled by default or managed differently.

Additionally, the `UserWarning` about the `type` parameter for `gr.Chatbot` suggests we should explicitly set `type="messages"` for the chatbot, which uses a more modern OpenAI-style dictionary format for messages. This will require adjusting how message history is processed.

Here's how we'll fix these issues in `app_gradio.py`:

1.  **Remove unsupported parameters**: Delete `retry_btn`, `undo_btn`, and `clear_btn` from the `gr.ChatInterface` initialization.
2.  **Set Chatbot type**: Add `type="messages"` to the `gr.Chatbot` component.
3.  **Update history processing**: Modify the `chat_with_agent` function to correctly interpret the `history` object when `type="messages"`. The history will now be a list of dictionaries (e.g., `{'role': 'user', 'content': '...'}`).
4.  **Refine image response**: Adjust the return value of `chat_with_agent` when only an image is generated. We'll ensure that the tool's success message (which includes the filename) is returned as the textual part of the response, so Gradio can use it as alt text and we can reconstruct the AIMessage for history.

#### fix  

Okay, the error `AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'` happens because the Gradio `ChatInterface` (when using `type="messages"`) expects your function (`chat_with_agent`) to return the *content* of the assistant's message in a specific format. It expects either:
*   A simple string for text-only responses.
*   A list containing tuples for responses with files, where each tuple is `(filepath, alt_text_or_caption)`.

Your current code returns tuples like `(filepath, text)` directly, which Gradio doesn't interpret correctly in this mode.

We need to modify the return statements in `app_gradio.py` to match the expected format.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* for `app_gradio.py`:

````python
app_gradio.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    # 5. Return the formatted response for Gradio ChatInterface
    if image_path_for_turn and text_response_for_turn:
        # Image and text: Gradio will use text_response_for_turn as caption/alt_text
        return (image_path_for_turn, text_response_for_turn)
    elif image_path_for_turn: # Only image was produced, text_response_for_turn is empty
        # Extract the tool message content as the textual response

        # Image and text: Return list with tuple (filepath, caption)
        return [(image_path_for_turn, text_response_for_turn)]
    elif image_path_for_turn: # Only image was produced, text_response_for_turn is empty
        # Extract the tool message content as the caption
        tool_message_text = "Image generated." # Default caption
        for msg in new_messages_from_graph:

                tool_message_text = str(msg.content) # Use tool success message as caption
                break
        # Image only: Return list with tuple (filepath, caption)
        return [(image_path_for_turn, tool_message_text)]
    elif text_response_for_turn:
        # Text only: Return the string content
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````

This change ensures that when an image is generated, the function returns a list containing a tuple `[(filepath, caption)]`, which is the format Gradio expects for the assistant's message content when `type="messages"` and files are involved. Text-only responses remain as simple strings.

After applying this change, please try running the Gradio app again:
```bash
uv run python app_gradio.py

#### fix  

Okay, it seems the previous fix was close but didn't quite match the exact format Gradio's `ChatInterface` expects when `type="messages"` and files are involved.

The error `AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'` persists because Gradio's internal function `_message_as_message_dict` expects the list returned by your function to contain *dictionaries* for file messages, not tuples. Specifically, it expects dictionaries with keys like `"file"` and `"alt_text"`.

Let's adjust the return statements in `app_gradio.py` to provide this dictionary format within the list.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* for `app_gradio.py`:

````python

        return [(image_path_for_turn, text_response_for_turn)]
    elif image_path_for_turn: # Only image was produced, text_response_for_turn is empty
        # Extract the tool message content as the caption
        tool_message_text = "Image generated." # Default caption
        for msg in new_messages_from_graph:
            if isinstance(msg, ToolMessage) and msg.name == "midjourney_image_generator":
                tool_message_text = str(msg.content) # Use tool success message as caption
                break
        # Image only: Return list with tuple (filepath, caption)
        return [(image_path_for_turn, tool_message_text)]

        return [{"role": "assistant", "content": [{"file": image_path_for_turn, "alt_text": text_response_for_turn}]}]
    elif image_path_for_turn: # Only image was produced, text_response_for_turn is empty
        # Extract the tool message content as the caption
        tool_message_text = "Image generated." # Default caption
        for msg in new_messages_from_graph:
            if isinstance(msg, ToolMessage) and msg.name == "midjourney_image_generator":
                tool_message_text = str(msg.content) # Use tool success message as caption
                break
        # Image only: Return list containing a dict with "file" and "alt_text" keys
        return [{"role": "assistant", "content": [{"file": image_path_for_turn, "alt_text": tool_message_text}]}]
    elif text_response_for_turn:
        # Text only: Return the string content directly
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````
Wait, looking at the Gradio source again, the function `fn` should return the *content* part, not the full message dictionary. The previous fix returning `[(filepath, caption)]` was closer. The issue might be how `_message_as_message_dict` handles that list internally. Let's revert the return format slightly and ensure the list contains the correct structure expected by the file handling part.

```python
app_gradio.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH

    elif image_path_for_turn: # Only image was produced, text_response_for_turn is empty
        # Extract the tool message content as the caption
        tool_message_text = "Image generated." # Default caption

                break
        # Image only: Return list with tuple (filepath, caption)
        return [(image_path_for_turn, tool_message_text)]
    elif text_response_for_turn:
        # Text only: Return the string content

    # 5. Return the formatted response for Gradio ChatInterface (type="messages" mode)
    # The function should return the *content* for the assistant's message.

    if image_path_for_turn and text_response_for_turn:
        # Image and text: Return list containing a dict with "file" and "alt_text" keys
        return [{"file": image_path_for_turn, "alt_text": text_response_for_turn}]
    elif image_path_for_turn: # Only image was produced, text_response_for_turn is empty
        # Extract the tool message content as the caption
        tool_message_text = "Image generated." # Default caption

    elif text_response_for_turn:
        # Text only: Return the string content directly

````

This revised fix returns the *content* part as expected: a string for text, or a list of dictionaries `[{"file": filepath, "alt_text": caption}]` for images.

#### fix  

Okay, the `KeyError: 'text'` indicates that Gradio's internal function `_message_as_message_dict` is expecting a dictionary with a key named `"text"` when processing the assistant's message content, especially when it involves files.

My previous fix used `"alt_text"`. Let's change the key used for the caption/text accompanying the image from `"alt_text"` to `"text"` in the dictionaries returned by `chat_with_agent`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* for `app_gradio.py`:

````python

        return [{"file": image_path_for_turn, "alt_text": text_response_for_turn}]
    elif image_path_for_turn: # Only image was produced, text_response_for_turn is empty
        # Extract the tool message content as the caption
        tool_message_text = "Image generated." # Default caption
        for msg in new_messages_from_graph:

                tool_message_text = str(msg.content) # Use tool success message as caption
                break
        # Image only: Return list containing a dict with "file" and "alt_text" keys
        return [{"file": image_path_for_turn, "alt_text": tool_message_text}]
    elif text_response_for_turn:

        # Image and text: Return list containing a dict with "file" and "text" keys
        return [{"file": image_path_for_turn, "text": text_response_for_turn}]
    elif image_path_for_turn: # Only image was produced, text_response_for_turn is empty
